abstract: Humans spend an increasing amount of time indoors. While it is relatively easy to find the bestroute between buildings, it is more difficult to find the best route within a building. 
  This is aparticular problem for large, complex buildings with a high fluctuation of visitors like inuniversity buildings. In this contribution, we show how an interactive web-based 3D campusrouting and information system (CRIS) can be designed using ArcGIS Indoors and the ArcGISplatform. From a scientific point of view, we focus on the question how this system needs tobe designed in order to facilitate effective and efficient indoor routing. The most importantdesign elements of the CRIS were identified by conducting a user study with experts inCartography. This study showed that the system can help users without prior knowledge insolving routing tasks.
