abstract: Background: Featuring landmarks on navigation aids is one method proposed to improve wayfinding outcomes. 
    However, there is little attention given to the how the  depiction of specific features of landmarks on mobile-maps modulate attention and spatial learning during navigation. Aims: In the present study, we aimed to assess how the provision of realistic landmark symbols on a mobile-map, compared to abstract symbols, affected the processing of relevant information during navigation, and the acquisition of spatial knowledge. Methods: Fortysix participants navigated a route in the real world prescribed via a mobile-map. The map featured 3D landmark symbols in either realistic or abstract formats. We recorded eye-movements and electroencephalography (EEG) throughout and administered postnavigation tests of spatial knowledge. Results: Subjects spent more time attending to the environment during portions of the route that had realistic landmark symbols on the map, although this effect was modulated by self-reported spatial ability. Lower-ability subjects spent more time attending to task-relevant landmarks that had realistic symbols, whereas higher-ability subjects spent more time attending to the whole environment in general. Interestingly, this did not result in improved explicit spatial knowledge for the realistic landmarks. However, examination of EEG fixation-related-potentials revealed an enhanced P200 amplitude for realistically displayed landmarks, signifying improved implicit recognition and perceptual matching of real-world landmarks to their map symbol counterparts. Conclusion: Visualising landmarks as realistic compared to abstract symbols benefits the direction of visual attention towards, and implicit recognition of, important information during navigation. However, this does not result in improved explicit spatial knowledge.
