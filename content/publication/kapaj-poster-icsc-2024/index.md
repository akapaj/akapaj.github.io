abstract: Background - Longitudinal studies assessing long-term spatial memory retention for real-world navigation tasks, aided by mobile maps enriched with landmark   
    information, are scarce. Because the importance of landmarks for navigation and spatial learning has been wellestablished, landmark depiction on ubiquitous mobile maps has become popular to counter the negative influence mobile map aids have on short- and long-term spatial memory formation and retention. Aims - This longitudinal study assesses the long-term retention of landmark and route knowledge of participants who took part in a previous real-world map-aided navigation study. Methods - The initial study used a within-subject design with the landmark visualization style as the independent variable. Ten task-relevant landmarks were saliently depicted on the map as realistic or abstract 3D symbols. Forty-six participants were asked to navigate a 1 km real-world route with the map aid once. Of those, 25 participants returned for the present follow-up study (mean delay = 725.2 Â± 15.77 days). We assessed their long-term retention of landmark and route knowledge about the route traversed in the initial study. Results - Returning participants performed above chance level on the landmark and route knowledge tests, showing long-term retention of spatial knowledge. Repeated-measure ANOVAs within the visualization condition and retention interval revealed that regardless of the visualization condition, landmark knowledge decreased over the retention period as expected, while, surprisingly, route knowledge was unaffected. Conclusion - These results contribute to a better understanding of spatial memory formation and long-term retention after a single route exposure aided by a mobile map enriched with salient landmarks.
