abstract: Landmarks serve to structure the environment we experience, and therefore
  they are also critically important for our everyday movement through and knowledge
  acquisition about space. How to effectively visualize landmarks to support spatial
  learning during map-assisted pedestrian navigation is still an open question. We
  thus set out to assess how landmark visualization styles (i.e., abstract 2D vs.
  realistic 3D) influence map-assisted spatial learning of expert wayfinders in an
  outdoor navigation study. Below we report on how the visualization of landmarks
  on mobile maps might influence wayfinder’s gaze behavior while trying to find a
  set of landmarks along a given route in an unfamiliar environment. We find that
  navigators assisted with mobile maps showing realistic-looking 3D landmarks more
  equally share their visual attention on task-relevant information, while those assisted
  with maps containing abstract 2D landmarks frequently switch their visual attention
  between the visualized landmarks and the mobile map to complete the navigation task.
  The presented analysis approach for the assessment of wayfinder’s gaze patterns
  has the potential to contribute ecologically valid insights for the understanding
  of human visual attention allocation during outdoor navigation, and to further understand
  how landmark depiction styles on mobile maps might guide wayfinders’ visual attention
  back to the environment to support spatial learning during map-assisted navigation.
