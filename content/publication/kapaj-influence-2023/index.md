abstract: Humans increasingly rely on mobile maps to facilitate everyday mobility. 
  These omnipresent navigation aids deteriorate spatial learning by captivating users’ attention. Landmarks facilitate spatial learning, yet, how to saliently depict them on mobile maps for guided attention and facilitated visual matching between the map and the environment remains an open question. We conducted a real-world navigation study to assess how 3D landmark visualizations (realistic vs. abstract) influence visual attention and spatial learning. Spatial learning with realistic landmarks improved when wayfinders exhibited shorter fixations on the map. Realistic landmarks also supported spatial learning of low spatial ability wayfinders. Our findings call for landmark depiction on mobile maps that go beyond “one fits all” and is based on human-adaptive design guidelines
