abstract: Depicting landmarks on mobile maps is an increasingly popular countermeasure
  to the negative effect that navigation aids have on spatial learning – landmarks
  guide visual attention and facilitate map-to-environment information matching. However,
  the most effective method to visualize landmarks on mobile map aids remains an open
  question. We conducted a real-world navigation study outdoors to evaluate the influence
  of realistic vs. abstract 3D landmark visualization styles on wayfinders’ navigation
  performance, visual attention, and spatial learning. While navigating with realistic
  landmarks, low-spatial-ability wayfinders focused more on the landmarks in the environment
  and demonstrated improved knowledge of directions between landmarks. Our findings
  emphasize the importance of visual realism when enriching navigation aids with landmarks
  to guide attention and enhance spatial learning for low-spatial-ability wayfinders.
