abstract: "Even though they are day-to-day activities, humans find navigation and
  wayfinding to be cognitively challenging. To facilitate their everyday mobility,
  humans increasingly rely on ubiquitous mobile maps as navigation aids. However,
  the over-reliance on and habitual use of omnipresent navigation aids deteriorate
  humans' short-term ability to learn new information about their surroundings and
  induces a long-term decline in spatial skills. This deterioration in spatial learning
  is attributed to the fact that these aids capture users' attention and cause them
  to enter a passive navigation mode. Another factor that limits spatial learning
  during map-aided navigation is the lack of salient landmark information on mobile
  maps.<br/>
   <br/>
  Prior research has already demonstrated that wayfinders rely on landmarks—geographic
  features that stand out from their surroundings—to facilitate navigation and build
  a spatial representation of the environments they traverse. Landmarks serve as anchor
  points and help wayfinders to visually match the spatial information depicted on
  the mobile map with the information collected during the active exploration of the
  environment. Considering the acknowledged significance of landmarks for human wayfinding
  due to their visibility and saliency, this thesis investigates an open research
  question: how to graphically communicate landmarks on mobile map aids to cue wayfinders'
  allocation of attentional resources to these task-relevant environmental features.
  From a cartographic design perspective, landmarks can be depicted on mobile map
  aids on a graphical continuum ranging from abstract 2D text labels to realistic
  3D buildings with high visual fidelity. Based on the importance of landmarks for
  human wayfinding and the rich cartographic body of research concerning their depiction
  on mobile maps, this thesis investigated how various landmark visualization styles
  affect the navigation process of two user groups (expert and general wayfinders)
  in different navigation use contexts (emergency and general navigation tasks). Specifically,
  I conducted two real-world map-aided navigation studies to assess the influence
  of various landmark visualization styles on wayfinders' navigation performance,
  spatial learning, allocation of visual attention, and cognitive load.<br/>
   <br/>
  In Study I, I investigated how depicting landmarks as abstract 2D building footprints or
  realistic 3D buildings on the mobile map affected expert wayfinders' navigation
  performance, visual attention, spatial learning, and cognitive load during an emergency
  navigation task. I asked expert navigators recruited from the Swiss Armed Forces
  to follow a predefined route using a mobile map depicting landmarks as either abstract
  2D building footprints or realistic 3D buildings and to identify the depicted task-relevant
  landmarks in the environment. I recorded the experts' gaze behavior with a mobile
  eye-tracer and their cognitive load with EEG during the navigation task, and I captured
  their incidental spatial learning at the end of the task. The wayfinding experts'
  exhibited high navigation performance and low cognitive load during the map-aided
  navigation task regardless of the landmark visualization style. Their gaze behavior
  revealed that wayfinding experts navigating with realistic 3D landmarks focused
  more on the visualizations of landmarks on the mobile map than those who navigated
  with abstract 2D landmarks, while the latter focused more on the depicted route.
  Furthermore, when the experts focused for longer on the environment and the landmarks,
  their spatial learning improved regardless of the landmark visualization style.
  I also found that the spatial learning of experts with self-reported low spatial
  abilities improved when they navigated with landmarks depicted as realistic 3D buildings.<br/>
   <br/>
  In Study II, I investigated the influence of abstract and realistic 3D landmark
  visualization styles on wayfinders sampled from the general population. As in Study
  I, I investigated wayfinders' navigation performance, visual attention, spatial
  learning, and cognitive load. In contrast to Study I, the participants in Study
  II were exposed to both landmark visualization styles in a navigation context that
  mimics everyday navigation. Furthermore, the participants were informed that their
  spatial knowledge of the environment would be tested after navigation. As in Study
  I, the wayfinders in Study II exhibited high navigation performance and low cognitive
  load regardless of the landmark visualization style. Their visual attention revealed
  that wayfinders with low spatial abilities and wayfinders familiar with the study
  area fixated on the environment longer when they navigated with realistic 3D landmarks
  on the mobile map. Spatial learning improved when wayfinders with low spatial abilities
  were assisted by realistic 3D landmarks. Also, when wayfinders were assisted by
  realistic 3D landmarks and paid less attention to the map aid, their spatial learning
  improved.<br/>
   <br/>
  Taken together, the present real-world navigation studies provide ecologically
  valid results on the influence of various landmark visualization styles on wayfinders.
  In particular, the studies demonstrate how visualization style modulates wayfinders'
  visual attention and facilitates spatial learning across various user groups and
  navigation use contexts. Furthermore, the results of both studies highlight the
  importance of individual differences in spatial abilities as predictors of spatial
  learning during map-assisted navigation. Based on these findings, the present work
  provides design recommendations for future mobile maps that go beyond the traditional
  concept of \\\"one fits all.\\\" Indeed, the studies support the cause for landmark
  depiction that directs individual wayfinders' visual attention to task-relevant
  landmarks to further enhance spatial learning. This would be especially helpful
  for users with low spatial skills. In doing so, future mobile maps could dynamically
  adapt the visualization style of landmarks according to wayfinders' spatial abilities
  for cued visual attention, thus meeting individuals' spatial learning needs."
